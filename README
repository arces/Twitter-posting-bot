This is a twitter bot that will pick a random verb, noun, and adjective and put it into a sentence and tweet it out.

Put templates, such as "Tom, why did you _V_ that _A_ _N_?!" (omit the quotes) in templates.txt. Place adjectives, nouns, and verbs in their respective files. Examples are provided.

Edit twitterbot.py and add your keys.

Run python ./twitterbot.py in the directory.

This code runs @tom_paulus_bot.
